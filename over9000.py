#Define the function to accept a list of numbers
#Create a variable to keep track of our sum
#Iterate through every element in our list of numbers
#Within the loop, add the current number we are looking at to our sum
#Still within the loop, check if the sum is greater than 9000. If it is, end the loop
#Return the value of the sum when we ended our loop

My solution:

def over_nine_thousand(lst):
  sum1 = 0
  for num in lst:
    sum1 += num
    if sum1 >= 9000:
      break
  return sum1

Test:
print(over_nine_thousand([8000, 900, 120, 5000]))
